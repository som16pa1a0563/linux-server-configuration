# Linux Server Configuration

> Dustin D'Avignon

## About

This is the sixth project for the Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree. This project involves taking a baseline installation of Linux on a virtual machine and preparing it to host web applications. This includes installing updates, securing the server from attacks, and installing / configuring web and database servers.


# Server Info

- **Public IP:** 34.210.194.203
- **Port:** 2200

- http://34.210.194.203/

## Getting Started

Ts project uses [Amazon Lightsail](https://amazonlightsail.com/) to create a Linux server instance.

1. Get your server.

    - Start a new Ubuntu Linux server instance on Amazon Lightsail. 
        
        * Log in!
        * Create an instance
        * Choose an instance image: Ubuntu (OS only)
        * Choose your instance plan (lowest tier is fine)
        * Give your instance a hostname
        * Wait for startup
        * Once the instance has started up, follow the instructions provided to SSH into your server.

2. Secure your server.

    - Update all currently installed packages.
    
            sudo apt-get update
            sudo apt-get upgrade
            
        auto upgrades run
            sudo dpkg-reconfigure --priority=low unattended-upgrades
    - Change the SSH port from 22 to 2200. Make sure to configure the Lightsail firewall to allow it.
            
            sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        change port form 22 to 2200
        
        
    - Configure the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) to only allow incoming connections for SSH (port 2200), HTTP (port 80), and NTP (port 123).
        
            sudo ufw allow 2200/tcp
            sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
            sudo ufw allow 123/tcp
            sudo ufw enable

        Warning: When changing the SSH port, make sure that the firewall is open for port 2200 first, so that you don't lock yourself out of the server. Review this video for details! When you change the SSH port, the Lightsail instance will no longer be accessible through the web app 'Connect using SSH' button. The button assumes the default port is being used. There are instructions on the same page for connecting from your terminal to the instance. Connect using those instructions and then follow the rest of the steps.
        

3. Give grader access.

    In order for your project to be reviewed, the grader needs to be able to log in to your server.

    - Create a new user account named grader.
    
            sudo adduser grader
    - Give grader the permission to sudo.
    
            sudo vim /etc/sudoers.d/grader
        add text `grader ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL`
    - Create an SSH key pair for grader using the ssh-keygen tool.
            
                ssh-keygen -t rsa
                
            To login
                ssh -i .ssh/grader_udacity grader@34.210.194.203 -p 2200


4. Prepare to deploy your project.

    - Configure the local timezone to UTC.
    
            sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
            
        * select none of the above, then UTC
            
    - Install and configure Apache to serve a Python mod_wsgi application.
    
        ngnix is used instead of Apache
        
        configuration steps can be found here

    - Install and configure PostgreSQL:
    
            sudo apt-get install postgresql

5. Do not allow remote connections
    
    Create a new database user named catalog that has limited permissions to your catalog application database.

6. Deploy the Item Catalog project.
